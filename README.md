## Questions and Solutions

### Question 1: Find the Better Location

**Objective:** Determine which of two cities is a better location based on a specified weather condition.

**API Endpoints:**
- Get city names and condition: `https://quest.squadcast.tech/api/RA2111032010006/weather`
- Get weather details for a city: `https://quest.squadcast.tech/api/RA2111032010006/weather/get?q=city_name`

**Conditions:**
- `hot`: Higher temperature
- `cold`: Lower temperature
- `windy`: Higher wind value
- `rainy`: Higher rain value
- `sunny`: Lower cloud cover
- `cloudy`: Higher cloud cover

**Submission URL:** `https://quest.squadcast.tech/api/RA2111032010006/submit/weather?answer={your_answer}&extension={extension_used}`

**Example Code:**
```python
# import requests and other necessary libraries here
# define and implement the solution code for this question
# and submit as per the instructions provided above
```

### Question 2: Find the IP Address Written in Words

**Objective:** Extract and parse an IP address written in words from a passage, then submit it in standard IPv4 format.

**API Endpoints:**
- Get passage: `https://quest.squadcast.tech/api/RA2111032010006/worded_ip`

**Submission URL:** `https://quest.squadcast.tech/api/RA2111032010006/submit/worded_ip?answer={your_answer}&extension={extension_used}`

**Example Code:**
```python
# import requests, re, and other necessary libraries
# define and implement the solution to extract and format IP address
# and submit as per the instructions provided above
```

### Question 3: Decrypt the Encrypted Message

**Objective:** Decrypt a message encrypted with the Fernet method, replace Unicode representations of emojis with actual emojis, and submit the result.

**API Endpoints:**
- Get payload and decryption key: `https://quest.squadcast.tech/api/RA2111032010006/emoji`

**Submission URL:** `https://quest.squadcast.tech/api/RA2111032010006/submit/emoji?answer={your_answer}&extension={extension_used}`

**Example Code:**
```python
# import requests, cryptography, re, and other necessary libraries
# define and implement the solution to decrypt and convert emoji codes
# and submit as per the instructions provided above
```

---

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `requests`, `re`, `cryptography`, and `beautifulsoup4` libraries (for Python). Install them via pip if necessary:
  ```bash
  pip install requests cryptography beautifulsoup4
  ```

### Running the Solutions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Replace the code in each questionâ€™s solution template as per instructions.
3. Run each script in your command line to check if it fetches, processes, and submits correctly.
4. Verify the submission responses for successful execution.
